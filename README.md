## **Project Overview**

This project is a web-based extention prototype that allows users to interact with the menu of a specific organization. Users register and log in, rate and comment on individual menu items, filter dishes based on categories and ratings, view AI generated conclusive reviews, and manage a cart of selected items. 

## **Features**

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and maintain active sessions with email-based authentication.
- **Menu Item Rating & Commenting**: Users can rate dishes from 1-5 stars and leave comments about their dining experience.
- **Category Filter**: Users can filter menu items by categories (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts).
- **Sorting**: Users can sort dishes by rating (highest to lowest, lowest to highest) and by the number of reviews.
- **AI Generated Review**: Users can view AI generated conclusive reviews based on previous user entries.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add items to a cart, view selected items, and remove them if desired.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Authentication**: Email-based authentication
